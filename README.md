## Technology used
Javascript

NodeJS 

Express
React
Bootstrap 
PostGres
Google Places API

npm install
 "dependencies": {
    "bootstrap": "^4.3.1",

    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "express": "^4.17.1",

## Unsolved Problems
-Still Need an edit function and a better way to pull data other than just pulling data form the DOM

-On Heroku, if the user adds too a certain number of attractions to the summary
